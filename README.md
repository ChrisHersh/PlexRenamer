# PlexRenamer
Renames files so the Plex Media Server can process them more correctly

I am not responsible for anything this script may do, you use it at your own risk. I reccomend at least doing a dry run and make sure you're okay with all of the changes it will make

This scipt is designed for renaming the episodes to a sXX eYY format so plex has a greater chance of indexing the seasons properly. It was designed for a root folder that has N directories each representing 1 season


#TODO
	+Allow the episode counter to be independant of the season
	+Allow renaming within a single directory (no seasons)
